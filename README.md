### Development Setup (For Devs)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peter/tpa-compass.git
cd tpa-compass
npm install
```

#### To compile TypeScript:
```bash
npm run compile
```

This will:
- Compile everything from `tpa-compass-bp/src/`
- Output to `tpa-compass-bp/scripts/` (which Minecraft uses)

#### To zip into a `.mcaddon`:
```bash
npm run zip
```

This will:
- Create a `tpa-compass.mcaddon` file in the root
- Exclude `src/`, `node_modules/`, and unnecessary files

---

### How to Load in minecraft

- Use the `.mcaddon` from the root (run `npm run zip` first).
- Or manually copy `tpa-compass-bp` and `tpa-compass-rp` into the `com.mojang` `development_behavior_packs` and `development_resource_packs` folders.
